# For the Customer Coupon project:
# Context and Goal
The project is intended to exercise our data acquisition, cleaning, analysis and communication skill sets, especially visualization skills.
The exercise is to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” 
Drivers receive coupons that are intended to incentiize them to purchase goods and services near them.
There are many columns in the data and some data is misisng or is in awkward formats.
There are many options on how to proceed so part of the goal of the project is to not only answer prompts but to think and drill down further to get better answers.

# Data:
According to the assignment site: 
'This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).'

# Where Things Are
3 Main files:
prompt.ipynb
report.ipynb
coupon.csv
All of them are in the top level of this directory.

# Where to Look For Project Results
Look at report.ipynb

# Potential Issues
To run the prompt.ipynb code, need to choose whether you will source data from github, google drive, or your local drive.
The instructions in the prompt.ipynb at the top guide you through these choices. The default is to use github while using google colab environment.

The report.ipynb is purely text and images drawn from:
